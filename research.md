# Research
* * *
Our work is focused on unravelling the climate history of the Earth through analysis of the sedimentary record. We use tools such as geochemistry, sedimentology and numerical modelling to understand the causes, consequences and timescales of past environmental change, and how these changes are preserved in the geologic record. The [team](/team.md) works across multiple disciplines, time intervals and timescales. Some current research topics include:

* Causes and consequences of rapid deoxygenation
* Sedimentological responses to extreme warming
* Numerical modeling of sedimentary systems
* Cyclostratigraphic timescale construction
