<b>Welcome to the web pages of Prof. David B. Kemp and his stratigraphy and palaeoclimate research group at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan).</b>

Our work is focused on unravelling the climate history of the Earth through analysis of the sedimentary record. We use tools such as geochemistry, sedimentology and numerical modelling to understand the causes, consequences and timescales of past environmental change, and how these changes are preserved in the geologic record.

We are always keen to hear from motivated students interested in joining our group at either MSc or PhD level. 欢迎感兴趣的研究生或博士与我们联系，加入我们的研究团队!
